        </script>
        <p>
            The alert command is used to display an alert dialog with a specified message and an OK button. 
            It is often used to provide feedback or information to the user.
            The alert dialog will block the execution of the script until the user dismisses it by clicking OK.
            This means that any code following the alert command will not execute until the alert dialog is closed.
        </p>
        <p>  
            1. What is the difference between the two alert commands?
            The first alert command uses `window.alert`, which is a more explicit way to call the alert function,
            while the second one uses the global `alert` function directly.
            Both commands achieve the same result, but using `window.alert` can be clearer in contexts where multiple
            global functions might exist, as it explicitly refers to the `alert` function in the global `window` object.
        </p> 
        <p>      
            2. What is the global `window` object?
            The global `window` object represents the browser window or tab in which the script is running
        </p>
        <p>
            3. which command is exceuted first?
            Both alert commands are executed in the order they appear in the script.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. What happens if the user clicks OK on the alert dialog?
            When the user clicks OK, the alert dialog closes, and the script execution continues with any code that 
            follows the alert command.
